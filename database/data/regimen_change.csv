"1008","5684","3","thank you for discussing this patient and you decision is noted however in view of adherence challenges noted by fair adherence score and wild type virus still mixed with resistant  (I47IV) this implies that we could be missing some mutations on the profile due to sub optimal drug pressure at the time the profile was done. prior exposure to TDF for 2.5 yrs and evidence of failure on first line  (high VL) implies that there could be a K65R which may have archived hence TDF could be dented and not fully suceptible, TLD alone maybe sub optimal. our 3rd line principle is 2 full suppressive agent therefore i recommend we switch to TLD/DRV/r in view of the above.  I47V is a DRV associated mutation however DRV needs 3 or more mutations to be greatly compromised so we can still use it.","2771"

He has achieved VL suppression on the current regimen on several occasions. Was this the time he was under the care of the lady talked about?  Can we support him to embrace this ladyâ¬""s support? What was his side of the story about their relationship? Let us have individual then joint sessions with them to find a feasible way forward.  Regarding the regimen let us adjust it to TDF+3TC+ATV/r and support adherence. If they virally suppress on it they can be transitioned to TLD.

TLD would essentially mean you are introducing only DTG as the fully suppressive drug  yet the 3rdline principal requires you to introduce 2 full suppressive agents. i would opt for TDF/3TC/DTG /DRV/r for this patient as a robust and durable regimen and continue typing and managing the anemia.","4090"

"1614","6961","3","Following clarity that the child has had a long standing adherence challenges of not tolerating LPV/r formulations (pellets and tablets). I agree with the complete regimen switch but let us have adherence interventions in place to support viral suppression on the new regimen, Patient educations, regular psychosocial support from the counselors and clinicians, DOTS by the mother, linkage to OVC etcâ¬¦. 
The challenge is more of non-adherence than treatment failure. The child has never achieved VL suppression on the current regimen. This also shows on the HIV DR M184MV which shows the presence of both the wild type and drug resistant virus.

"1626","7007","3,4","About 7 months ago LPV/r was substituted for DTG by the facility team in abid to reduce pill burden yet the patient was still non suppressed, the recent HIVDR profile reveals how almost the entire classes of ARVs are compromised. therefore the patient has been on monotherapy of DTG alone for 7months now. DTG being a superior drug we still expect some activity from it if co-administered with other drugs from different classes which still have some activity. from this background the committee decided to give ABC/3TC/DTG/ETV/DRV/RTV as a better option to achieve sustainable virologic suppression. The team is aware of the drug to drug interaction between DTG and ETV but addition of a boosted PI (DRV/RTV) give the two drugs chance to work, of course ABC/3TC/DTG is a once daily pill and we can still leverage on the presence of the M184V with its half log effect on the virus. This 3rd line comes with alot of pill burden thus the facility team has been urged to strengthen adherence  ( DOTs), assess for PSS issues, do comprehensive AHD screening, re-assure the patient and do Viral at 6 months not forgetting baseline tests like RBS, HepB and LFTs-RFTs.","1674"

Noted mother is sero positive and in care at Kasanga Hope clinic, suppressed and on Multi month drug refills, currently not in any relationship. child stays with the grandparents and a 19 year old sister who supports her with taking medication. mother decided to take her to grandparents because its the nearest home to the childâ¬""s school. usually connects with child every weekend. she takes her meds at 7am, 7pm and misses doses if she leaves home earlier or comes back home late from prep. she is under OVC school support. For this and all other adolescents please have a complete assessment using the HEADSS tool. . For the regimen I propose with adjust it to TDF+3TC+ATV/r and support her to adhere. If she virally suppresses then she can be transitioned to TLD. I do hope mum has time to support her and a once daily will make this support easier. Lets continue to support adherence to this, conduct IAC and repeat HIV DR and VL following 3 good adherence sessions.

Key issues to address include:
1. PSS issues  (Occupation, income, treatment supporter to do DOTs, timing of pills, continue monthly IAC sessions, link to CHW)
2. Clinical Issues  (Malnutrition, AHD screening, Baseline RBS before starting DTG)

We see wild type virus mixed with resistant virus  (M41ML, K70KR, etc.) presence of wild type virus implied poor adherence hence the need to address the adherence barriers in this patient.
Letâ¬""s get a treatment supporter on board, continue with counseling sessions and switch t 3rdline TDF/3TC/DTG/DRV/r.

This patient was on ABC for over 10 years, and they failed on it. Ideally you wouldnâ¬""t use TDF as part of their next regimen. The mutations to ABC may have been archived because of non-adherence.

Clinician's Recommendation: Substitute from ABC-3TC-DTG to AZT-3TC-DTG
Clinician's comment: 8 year old boy staying with the grand ma with a non suppressing VL. On ABC/3TC/DTG, adherence barriers discovered was poor time mgt, economic barriers and poor client family support. Third line committee members decided to substitute this child to AZT/3TC/DTG since AZT is susceptible and ABC has low level resistence. Psychosocial support should be implemented to target economic empowerment. Grandma to start the process of disclosure. Depression score should be done on people supporting the child. Continue with IAC and do another HIV DR test after completion of IAC.
