Reason (s):
Comment: . This patient has never been exposed to AZT and DTG. The TDF+3TC+ATV/r though it was an inappropriate switch  ( a substitution other than a switch but  presume the clinician thought they had made a switch, was it based on clinical or immunological failure?) served as their 2nd line regimen  (It was more of ATV/r monotherapy as their 2nd line regimen). Continue with Intensive adherence counseling routinely. 2. Support the client on disclosure

the adolescent failed on first line AZt/3TC/NVP with a 5 log VL after 3.5 yrs on ART. possibly developed TAMS. we know TAMs dent the entire NRTI class including TDF and ABC. but ABC more than TDF. with this possible scenario the patient was more likely initiated on alluvia monotherapy on second line which is not durable enough hence persistent low viremias. however in the setting of non adherence which was prevalent at time the profile was done there was no enough drug pressure for the amplification of resistant virus on the profile hence the appearance of susceptible picture. the mutations have archived. why ABC when patient is above 30kgs? TDF might have some residual function than ABC.  ABC was given at switch possibly because the adolescent was less than 30kg once they turn 30 always move them to TDF unless there is a contraindication.

I would have been comfortable with optimizing this patient to TLD however we clearly see that the 3 TAMS even when they are of the less lethal pathway they dent TDF to low level resistance.
Even when we maintain TDF/3TC/ATV/r the 2 NNRTIs are dented already.
