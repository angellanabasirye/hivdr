She gets different experiences in each new environment she finds herself in including stigma; in fact, she has changed location more than 4 times and makes following her up a problem. The only time she has ever suppressed is when she was with the mother as her treatment companion. It is only her and the mother who are on ART and the mother has a suppressed viral load.

The first born and fifth born died of measles and anaemia respectively.
It hurts her when the love of her life walks away to stay in afar district.it has been so long about 14years when she last glanced at her husband's face.She was abandoned when pregnant of her last born.She used to please her husband but nevertheless he married four other women and lived with them in Kotido district.
With all the bad thoughts she had for her husband,one of her co-wives fell so sick and died of unknown illness but she believes that she must have died of HIV related illness since the husband and other co-wives declined an HIV test during the time she was diagnosed with HIV.The husband now enjoys life with the other three co-wives and yet she has nothing to do about it.
The worst thing that bothers her even most is that her two daughters decided to leave for Kotido to stay with their father and the only son also decides to go to the kraal to take care off other peoples cattle.
She now stays with a very young girl who happens to be the daughter of her second born who got pregnant while in senior three and dropped out off school despite much investment on her education.
The Son has now comeback home because of the insecurity in the kraal but she still remains helpless since he dropped out off school ten years ago while in P.3 and has no any income generating activity.
All her biological children are of unknown HIV serostatus.
Her husband is such a heartless man that he does not send her any help and even did not appear for the burial of his last born when he died.
Her confession is that she doesn't have the luxury to look at other men since her hope and belief is that her husband will someday return and thus she has never engaged in any other relationship.
She is so thankful to God that her husband had built for her a house at Kololo trading center in Napak district where she stays and the rent she collects is the only source of income at home.However her tenants stress her by not paying the small rent in time and others even evacuate and relocate with paying her money.
Much as she gets stress from her tenants and has a great feeling of loneliness,she has never thought of harming herself in anyway though she occasionally finds it hard to fall asleep at night.
She is a known alcoholic for over twenty five years and sniffs tobacco as well.
She is currently clinically stable with no opportunistic infections and WHO clinical stage I.
She completed TPT on the 17th/march/2017 and still continues on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.

She was on CBV/NVP which she started on 09/09/2008 .  Her baseline CD4 was 290. Her adherence while on 1st line was fair as it was being disrupted by her failure to take her evening dose the niverapine on time due to the retail shop that kept her busy. At times she would forget to take her evening dose altogether . She was switched to 2nd Line on 20/08/2018   and in the past one and a half years, she has been under stress as her husband was involved in a RTA which made her the sole bread winner as the husband was bed ridden. This also led to the collapse of her shop. Because of this her last  physical visit to the facility was on 16/09/2021 and the supply which took her up to 18/12/2021 was delivered by us up to her home free of charge. She is supposed to have come back on 18/12/2021 which she did not do. The counsellors have called her but cuts short the discussion saying she would call again ending up not doing  it. The last call was on 14th March 2022. Does not use alcohol or the addictive drugs."

2710,4664,2022/03/14 17:58:58,"    SI an 11-year old male is the last born of a family of three children born in June 2011.He is a total orphan whose father and mother died including his siblings. The mother was married in teso however left with her second born while pregnant of her last born after the death of her beloved husband since her situation became worse. The first born had died already before the death of her husband.
The situation became even more worse and she had no choice but to rent at matany trading center with her second born and shortly after, the grandmother took away the second born who later passed on after falling so sick and died on arrival at Matany Hospital of unknown illness.
She waited until finally she gave birth to her third born whom she delivered at home and only took for immunization. She had not been attending ANC and the child did not receive niverapine prophylaxis but later as the child attended EPI schedule, the mother was diagnosed with HIV and child tested positive by HIV PCR and both the mother and the child were linked into care on 15/September/2011.It was so sad that the mother fell so sick and died ten months later on June 2012.
He now stays with his maternal grandparents, a grandmother of 65years and a grandfather of 83years. Him and the grandparents have a challenge of getting what to eat. The grand mother is the only person who supports the family by selling firewood to earn a living. She walks a distance of about 5km with one or two bunches of firewood on her head to reach matany market, a point where she sells it each at 2000/=. Itâ¬""s this money she uses for buying food, medication and also for her alcohol and tobacco since she drinks and sniffs as well. They normally have one meal per day and this tends to affect his drug adherence as he cannot tolerate taking medicine on an empty stomach and also the grandmother has resorted to giving him drugs once daily instead of twice daily dosing.
Much as the grandmother has six children alive, they are not supportive to her. The four sons are shepherds taking care of peopleâ¬""s cattle two in teso region and two within Kraals in Karamoja region.
The two daughters are all married but donâ¬""t even visit or send any support to her. 
SI was admitted in matany Hospital and managed for SAM and PTB on 25/06/2015 for which he completed treatment and declared cured. He was then initiated on INH prophylaxis and completed.
He started school this year and is in Primary one. He interacts well with his peers without any discrimination.SI likes playing football and â¬Üâ¬""edongaâ¬"" â¬"".He is however not fully disclosed and therefore his grandmother usually escorts him to the clinic for his drug refill.
He is currently clinically stable with no opportunistic infections and WHO clinical stage I.

3rd Line Preparations

Pt has been referred  back for the above preparations.  Assessed barrier to adherence for rx failure and below are the underlying issues:
1) partner is not disclosed to and she is not willing to do it as she fears loosing her marriage.  Ever since she got into relationship with the father of her last child she has been having adherence challenges as she takes meds in hiding.  Also ever since lockdown, the partner is not working and most times he is home in their one roomed house leading to missing doses

2) She reports to have been bewitched and the partner took her took to his village in Busoga where she spent 2 months and she feared carrying the meds with her for fear of accidental disclosure

Plan
Discussed the meaning of having a high viral load and a low CD4 as it can lead to ill health which she is experiencing, transimission of HIV and also accidental disclosure of which she is scared of
Discussed how she can benefit from improved adherence as the above effects of poor adherence can be prevented
Gave her information of how her first and 2nd line have failed and she is being prepared for 3rd line but has no option of OD.  She has been encouraged to try all means of making sure that she takes the ART without missing.  She has reported that is going to change time, try to get where to keep her meds to prevent partner seeing them
Discussed the advantages of disclosure as well other than waiting the partner to find out as the effects might not be the same.

MS has had only one suppressed viral load ever since she initiated on treatment and this was earlier attributed to her nature of work where by she was teaching in a certain primary school and the pressure from work could not allow her pick and also take her drugs on time. During the same period the husband stopped supporting the family which made life harder for her hence more stress to support her adherence on treatment.

In 2019, MS got one suppressed viral load and this was attributed to the empowerment through counselling for her to move on with her life but also eventually re-united with the husband where she got full psychosocial support.

After re-uniting with the husband, MS's parents forced the husband to pay dowry price and also could most times stop their daughter from going back to her marriage before the price is paid. This has affected MS's adherence since their home is in Mbarara and has not disclosed her HIV status to the family making it hard to take drugs every time she is at  her home. 

MS has been missing appointment due to over moving to her village, however on the most recent follow-up attempt she promised to come back fully to her marriage in Mukono since the husband is almost finalizing with the dowry payments. This implies that MS is currently not on treatment since she last visited the facility on 7th /12/ 2021 where she was given one month refill that was to carry her up to 7/1/2022."

The child's father died was left to her grandmother who is a mother to her mother, though both are not reliable RX buddies for they are not vigilant and mentally unstable. The child has just started school this year but still the grandmother is unable to raise school fees for her because she is not working. Ever since she started ART she has been a non suppressor to date. This is due to the negligence of the caretakers who always fail to keep the Child's clinic appointments and sometimes the child could become lost to follow-up, they also failed to practice good adherence where the child is given under doses. for example the child could be given 1 pill from a tin until when it gets over, not as it is prescribed. Several home visits have been conducted and even drug delivery but still the grandmother failed to make a change, a lot of drugs being found with her yet she had already missed appointments.
we opted to link her to neighbors for support but due to stigma the grandmother has, she refused that she doesn't want to be known by the other people who could make a lot of noise to her, even the fellow young ones sometimes could make fun out of it.
The child was linked to OVC by then it was CHEDRA for more support like food, income generating activities  for the grandmother.
Due to financial problems the grandmother could barely move a long distance from Gayaza to Masaka to pick the child's drugs. But the major problem the grandmother cannot afford to give the child drugs very well as her mental status is questionable.
However this case was discussed. Following the discussion of HIV DR, it was noted that the child was susceptible to most medicines, so, we maintained the regimen and there is need fir a reliable Rx supporter to apply DOTs. VL to be repeated after 3 months

She now claims that she is all by herself and even her old friends no longer want to associate with her. because of the fact that she is reminded openly, even visitors at home often open her suit case to look for the medicines she takes and they end up disorganizing her staffs. 
when asked about her sex life, she admitted that she is sexually active and is on injectable FP,  (does not use any barrier). she mentioned that her boyfriend was disclosed to, is aware of her status and he also admitted that he is taking ARVs but the injectable type.

5733,6303,2023/01/23 17:42:05,"Client is a 16 year male, attending a boarding school in S.2. Client stays with multiple treatment supporters i.e father, biological mother and step-mother. The child has been struggling to adhere to his treatment and has been switched to a second line of treatment. This is likely due to a lack of supervision and support from his caregivers.
I had chance to interact with both the father and biological mother; The mother denied staying with the child for so long and only gets chance to be with child on rare occasions especially in holidays thus it's the dad who takes custody of the child. The biological mother asserted that the child has become disrespectful and does not listen to her advices anymore. 
In a detailed phone conversation over phone with the father, he revealed that he is not told full details whenever the child is brought to the clinic by the biological mother; the dad does not often come with the client to the clinic since he is always away on Safaris. He further stressed, he even came to realize that the child was poorly adhering to the treatment just in the recent months and that had even been switched to second line of treatment. 
On the other hand, the client attends a boarding school, S.2 and he keeps his own drugs in a school case. The child reported difficulties in taking the medication on time at school, particularly in the morning at 7am when he is rushed out of the dormitories by wardens before he has even taken drugs thus missing out. He also noted challenges of food insecurity like failure to get anything to eat before the drugs but the dad noted that they have been giving him upkeep money to use while at school and nurrified this as not being a substantial challenge. 
In addition, the father has revealed that the stepmother attempted to support the child in taking his medication by identifying a school matron to assist him, but the child allegedly rejected this idea and chosen to continue keeping his own drugs, asserting that he is grown up. The father also stated that the stepmother is more understanding and the child accords maximum respect to her, and she is the one who always encourages him to take drugs whenever both of them are around at home.
At their home in Gayaza, this child stays in a side-room  (boys quarter) next to the main house with his other two siblings. Another challenge that the child faces is his reluctance to take medication in front of his siblings who are not aware of his HIV status. The father acknowledged this challenge and has pledged to re-think of bringing him back to the main house where he can better supervise him and ensure that the child takes his medication on time.
Overall, it is clear that the child faces a number of challenges in adhering to his treatment, primarily due to a lack of supervision and support from his caregivers. The father has acknowledged these challenges and has pledged to take steps to ensure that the child receives the support and supervision he needs to effectively manage his HIV treatment.

5923,6129,2023/02/14 05:08:46,"K.H is a 29 year old male who has been on treatment since May 2004.
He is a second born amongst 3 children, where the other elder brother and young sister are both HIV negative; the dad passed on earlier and remained with a single mother for some while.
Later, the paternal in-laws  (aunts/uncles) requested the mother to take over custody over this child. He was taken to stay with one of the aunts around Kampala leaving the mother to stay at Tororo.
He attended school up to P.6 and eventually dropped out due to proneness to illness. He consistently fell sick at around 7 years and got hospitalised to various hospitals then finally to Mulago hospital where the child was diagnosed with HIV and CCM; by that time his CD4 were as low as 9. They kept at the wards for some while and finally the child got back to his feet and were discharged.
Around 2017, this client developed TB which compelled him to be admitted from Kiruddu hospital for a while until he completed the treatment course; the mother later went back to Tororo and left him with the aunts in Kampala.
His mother is also in care at Tororo regional Referral; also working as an Expert client  (Peer mother) at the above site. She noted that has always been supportive to the client to take drugs and sometimes pays a visit to him and the family in Kampala. 
The client works from Hoima as a truck driver at a sugar company and only comes back to Kampala once in a month and stays there for a few days. At Hoima, he rents a room at close proximity with his elder brotherâ¬""s home and the brother also always does his best to encourage the client be adherent on treatment. 
He is married to a while with a negative HIV sero-status  (disclosed to); with 2 kids  (girl and childâ¬all negative) according to the report from the mum but when talked to the client he noted that he has 10 known children with other kids from many ladies that could make the figure to 50 kids.
The most prominent challenge that was established by the mother was time management and more possibly missing a few doses especially when away at Safari. Client does not take alcohol or any other substance and was disclosed to at around 14-15 years; 
Mother made a commitment to continue supporting the client and his family and she even plans to shift to Kampala for work and this will give her ample opportunity to engage the client whenever he returns to Kampala.

He is  has  2  siblings   who were tested Negative ,  he attends clinic  with her cousin sister who is fully  suppressed and pursuing her  nursing course , Mother is alive  works with mild may  currently . Father passed on .  Mother is on ART   at Kassanda H/C . By 13yrs he was already disclosed to  and was in a boarding school  and had  started having  adherence  challenges  at school  as  the  VL that  time was > 10,000cp/ml .  It was reported that,  the school  nurse  was  the one  administering the medicines but at  times she would not be available and  so patient would miss his medication .  ( school was in fort portal  mother was staying in Mubende ).
   In 2013  it was noted that  patient was now keeping his medication and the nurse would remind him once in a while to take his medication , it was also noted that  patient always missed a number  of doses he  would miss 3  times  days a week  usually Monday rushing for assembly , Wednesday and  Sunday  rushing for church .
 In 2014  patient  reported that the nurse had left  and the drug admn was done by  himself ,  but he also had concerns why he was the only one  taking  ARVs  amongst his siblings . (Switched to 2 line in 2014 Jan .)
   In  2015 he  started S5 and was reporting improved  adherence .By  Nov 2015  patient was already failing on 2nd line  but  had not opened up to the counselor to address his  challenges.  He addressed his challenge in Dec 2015  when came back  as he had a critical lab and he said that  he  had  taken  some time  without taking the ATVr  as it was  too big not until the previous visit when he was given another   a bit smaller  ATVr  then he started  taking again . 
 In  2016 he  reported another challenge  of time mgt,  when the time passes him by he does not  take .
 In 2017  IAC  sessions were started , he had 6 IAC  sessions but in session he would   give different information  to the different  counsellors .The counsellors noted questionable  adherence .
In  2018 Mar he opened up to the Dr and informed her that  the barriers to his adherence was the school environment , nurse used to stigmatize him , he had  issues with  being  issued  a gate  pass  to come to the clinic , and also found a lot of trouble with the askaris  at school since he would  reach  late.
In 2018 Sep  he  reported that he  was at YMCA  and had  partner  who  was  in care at Mild may  ( 2nd  set of IAC  Sessions ,  the notes seem to be  the same  nothing much was gotten  from  them )
 In June 2019  he  was  diagnosed with TB  and  started treatment , substituted  ATVr  with LPVr  and doubled the dose .  ( this was already  a pill burden ) he defaulted and  was restarted  in Oct 2019.
 In 2020 he started leaving with his brother   at kalerwe  since he was  at YMCA  Wandegeya . missed appt in May returned sept  2020 but mother  reported that  they got refills from kasanda Mild May .
 Nov  2020 went  back to kasanda  and stayed with mother    he reported to be at the university pursuing  a diploma in computer  science  by then he was not sexually active . 
  IAC  sessions conducted between   October  -  Jan 2021  no adherence barrier  had been reported by  the patient .
 In 2021 Feb counselor noted that patient  had been off ART  for  a month  and  mother was no longer supportive ,  in  march it was noted that  he had   disclosure challenges  with  the people he used to stay with   and so he would fear to take his medicines . This time he said he had a girl  friend whose status he did not know  and  has not yet disclosed to her .
 In Mar  2021  he confessed that  he had been off ART  since 2017 until 2021  when it was restarted. 
His poor adherence  started   when he went to  fort portal from s1- s4  as he  would hide  and also miss a number of doses , so this became a normal thing  to him and he  would  do it  more often .
 Started 3rd line  in May  2021,   after 6 months he was suppressed .
 Sep 2022 he  got another  DVL of 244,000cp/ml 
 Called  mother on phone   Feb 2023 and informed me that  currently   patient is taking his medication  may be the morning dose  is  being  missed since mother is   not around most of the time but she is always available in the evening. 
 Mother  reported that currently he has no job keeps in the house  until in the evening when he is going for soccer .  He loves soccer  and also mother  wanted him to enroll for a  counseling training course at Mildmay but she is still looking for money .

She turned HIV positive after the first husband's death (He died in an accident) It is believed that she contracted HIV from the second husband. 
She rarely leaves her house and spends most of the time in bed. She claims her first husband's spirit forbids her to leave the house without permission. So she even eases herself in the house, which is usually very dirty. Luckily, her co-wife  (the first husband's wife) provided food for her from time to time. There is also a story in her village about how she cheated a business lady who bought beans from her and she didn't deliver. When this lady reported her to the authorities, the authorities sided with their own village mate and the business lady lost the case, and hence her money. The business lady cursed her and said that those beans that she has taken will be the last she will ever grow. By coincidence, she stopped going outside of the house at the time that lady said those words.
In 2022, a home visit was made by the peer attached to her and a counselor to deliver drugs and do CD4 and to also evaluate her living conditions. She was found to be infested with jiggers and was in a bad shape. The CD4 count was 171 and TB LAM turned positive. On doing a pill count it was discovered that she was rarely taking her medication. So they convinced her to come to the health facility and she was admitted since it was the only way to monitor how she was taking her medication. Her family was contacted and one of her daughters came to visit for one day and abandoned her after. She was living at the mercy of other caretakers who had patients at ward. A psychiatric evaluation was done on her and it was reported that she had a history of suicidal thoughts but had never attempted to end her life. She attributed the thoughts to severe headaches that were constant and would not allow her to sleep at night. The psychiatric nurse recommended that CrAG screening be done which turned negative. She also recommended that NJ should be given a treatment supporter to directly observe her taking the medication. She spent two weeks on ward after which she was discharged. The peer contacted one of her other children, a male from her second marriage and helped NJ disclose to him her HIV status. The peer further explained to him that since NJ was also now on TB treatment too, it was important that she gets a treatment supporter to help remind her to take her medication. He agreed to always make time to come and visit and to also clean around the house, which he actually did.
The last viral load results from September 2022 were 400 copies and the peer that was attached to NJ has continued her home visits to make drug deliveries and provide peer support."

7456,3320,2023/07/17 14:24:49,"Client is a 15 year old female who has experienced multiple detectable viral load copies since January 2017. The client discontinued her education at the primary level, and her mother attempted to seek support for vocational training but was unsuccessful. The client is currently not sexually active. Her mother receives care and stable treatment at a facility in Nkokonjeru. However, the mother faces economic hardships, and at one point got evicted from their home and the destructed their property, which further disrupted their well-being.
The primary barriers to the client's adherence to medication were her fear of the large ATVr pills. On several occasions, the client's mother reported sorting pills and throwing away the ATVr pills. As a solution, the mother was encouraged by counsellors to administer the medication through DOTs.
Presently, the client resides in Nkokonjeru with her mother and occasionally stays with her grandmother, who also resides in the same village. The client's mother is currently unemployed and has expressed concerns about the high transportation costs incurred from Nkokonjeru to the clinic, which amounts to 45,000 Ugandan Shillings. This expense often necessitates requesting longer refills from the clinic despite being non-suppressed for long. To mitigate this issue, the mother has always arranged for a boda boda rider to transport the client for a long distance from Nkokonjeru to attend the clinic alone, despite the associated risks, as there is no viable alternative at present.
In 2023, efforts by Baylor OVC team to enroll the client in a Catholic skill-building program in Nkokonjeru proved unsuccessful. The client's mother revealed that a payment of 350,000 Ugandan Shillings was required from her, which she was unable to afford due to her ongoing economic hardships.
The client currently works as a house help/maid in a nearby village. However, she has not disclosed her HIV status to her employer, which has led to challenges in adhering to her medication schedule. Previously, she would take her morning doses at 7:00 AM/PM but feared being noticed by her boss. As a solution, the client suggested shifting her drug time to 6:00 AM and PM, during the early morning hours when her boss is still asleep.
It is worth noting that the client reported an improvement in adherence when her medication was changed from ATVr to DTG based regimen, as the tablets are smaller in size. On January 10, 2023, her viral load was measured at 975 copies."

Adherence profile:
Several IACs have been made to support this childâ¬""s adherence, though the mother keeps on changing caretakers. The major barriers that are identified include; 
1.	At first the child could not take in the bitter pellets, she would vomit and therefore, had inadequate doses
2.	The motherâ¬""s stigma and carelessness towards her childâ¬""s adherence
3.	The mother has no reliable economic base, she keeps switching from one job to another sometimes they would lack food and therefore child would not be given medicine.
4.	She is in a new mother in a new relationship and claims to have disclosed to the partner who is HIV negative and live in Kalangala. The child was left with an aunt who lives in Kayabwe
5.	The child sometimes refuses drugs and other times she takes them at irregular time schedules and at other times she is left to administer her drugs yet she is too young to do so.
Below are the interventions 
1.	Several home visits are done to identify family and social support
2.	Linked to OVC services but because the child keeps on changing locations, their services have not yielded much.
3.	the mother is encouraged to stay with her child for proper drug administration 
4.	Different care takers are educated on the importance of ART
5.	Mother is linked to community economic empowerment SACOs

The mother acknowledged that the boy was initially vomiting the drugs, but he eventually stopped. Timing of the drug administration became the issue because she used to work in the market and would sometimes get home late, or even forget to give the child medicine.
For about one year now, the mother chose to work from home to be able to administer the children's medicine. The father was about to complete the construction of an extra room in which the mother would operate a salon and retail shop. 
The elder sister just made 8 years and she is not yet disclosed to as well. She is too young to take on the DOTS roll, or even to remind themselves.
The TASO expert client who doubles as a VHT in the same village pledged to always supervise the child's administration of the drugs at her home and the father pledged to always take the boy there for the morning dose on his way to school.
The evening dose would be administered  by the VHT from home and a copy of the keys to the storage of the drugs would be given to her in case the father was away for work- boda cyclist.
MJ would be changed to the sister's school, a public school since there were many restrictions at the boy's school and the trust to disclose to the school was not there.

BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE	
Engaged him regarding adherence issues  and  disclosed that he used to share his pills with some Old lady who was introduced to them as their  Grandmother  by his late Father ,but Client was not very sure whether she was indeed their Grandmother due to some of his reserved observations, he stated. 
She used to stay from a distance from where they stayed, had challenges of missing appointments from where she used to access treatment due to lack of transport .
His late Father had   instructed him to share doses with her whenever her pills got finished and she could not refund his pills.
Sharing his pills was a challenging state to him. He reported, because his Father had warned him not to disclose to anyone else including his Mother to the extent that even when his drugs got finished he could not open up yet it always got finished before his next appointment. 
Because of fear of disclosure as previously warned by his Father, Client decided to pretend to be taking his pills yet in actual sense, he had nothing to take and mother could not notice.
He lived moments of pretense until when the said to be Grandmother, he stated was taken away by his Sons and no longer in touch with her.
He reported a persisting cough that has lasted over two weeks even after treatment. He also had complaints of body aches including the arm after the COVID vaccination.
 
Engaged the Mother who was not aware of all that was going on and kept on thinking that he is mature enough to take his medicine without close monitoring.
  She suspected that he was not taking his medicines well, due to poor time management which she expressed to be caused by tight school programs and schedules. 
However, Mother is currently supporting him and they both reported improved adherence and expects better viral load results from the next test to be done.

But later he ignored  it all and accepted the situation and now moving on even  when things are not well with him, he communicated.

The client currently resides with his spouse in a discordant relationship, who is well aware of his condition and are currently expecting a child. It is worth noting that the client already has one child from a previous relationship, and he is no longer in contact with that child's mother. Unfortunately, the client's father passed away earlier, while his mother is still alive and receiving care at Nsambya Home Care, with her residence alternating between Mukono and Migadde. Financial and emotional support from the mother ceased some time ago, leaving the client to manage his health independently. The client's engagement with his mother stopped long time, and they take long to talk to each other unless its something crucial. He is the second-born among four siblings, including two girls and one boy, but he is the only one living with HIV. Professionally, the client works as a software engineer and app developer. His work primarily involves part-time engagement with MCOPA company, with his small office being situated at home where he conducts most of his operations. Additionally, he is associated with an online network marketing company owned by some whites. These commitments necessitate him to work overnight on the computer on a daily basis, leading to a disrupted sleep schedule. Consequently, he often misses his medication at 10am/pm, both during the day and night. Although the client's spouse is reportedly supportive and reminds him to take his medications, he frequently chooses to neglect his treatment due to his exhaustion from working overnight. Moreover, his spouse has recently started working and leaves for her job early in the morning, leaving the client without a support system almost every day now. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation, I reached out to the client's aunt, J.F, who also doubles as a staff member at the Baylor Clinic. She used to play a pivotal role in ensuring the client's consistent adherence to treatment. However, she noted a significant shift in their relationship since the client assumed greater responsibility and independence. Consequently, engaging the client in discussions about adherence and related social issues has become increasingly challenging for her. Finally, J.F has expressed her willingness to re-engage with the client to address his adherence issues. Her involvement may prove instrumental in helping the client regain a more structured approach to his treatment regimen. "

9521,9266,2023/11/10 18:34:38,"Note: Client ART No. 620 is a reference designation specifically assigned by Rubanda PHC HC III. This ART number was allocated upon the client's transfer from Ikumba HC III to Rubanda PHC HC III. 
This reference is employed to maintain confidentiality.
Born to a female sex worker in Kanungu, Client ART No. 620 faced challenges from an early age, losing their mother at one year old. With the help of the late mother's friends, the client reconnected with their grandmother in Rubanda district.
Three years after the mother's demise, the client's health began to deteriorate, leading the grandmother to seek local remedies. Subsequently, severe pneumonia prompted a visit to the nearby health facility, Ikumba HC III, where the client was diagnosed as HIV positive and initiated on AZT-3TC-NVP in September 2015. The treatment regimen was optimized to ABC-3TC-LPV/r in 2019. Despite efforts, the child's viral load remained non-suppressed, and the reasons were unknown to the healthcare workers managing Client ART No. 620.
Supporting groups, notably ICOBI now AVSI, were engaged to assist at the community level, but the viral load remained uncontrolled. HIV drug resistance testing showed no significant resistance, suggesting poor adherence. In September 2021, the client's health deteriorated further, leading to severe wasting, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea. Despite visits to Ikumba HC III, the health workers seemed to have given up on the client.
On the night of 23rd April 2022, the client experienced abnormal breathing, and the grandmother, lacking alternatives, returned to Ikumba HC III. Referral followed to Muko HC IV, then Kabale Regional Referral Hospital. Faced with despair and financial constraints, the grandmother decided to spend the night at Rubanda PHC HC III. Health workers there promptly attended to the client, initiating IV fluids and injectable antibiotics.
Upon review of the client's documents, it was noted that the child was on ABC-3TC  (600/300 mg)-LPV/r  (200/100 mg), with halved tablets to reduce pill burden. Transfer to Rubanda PHC HC III was processed, and intensive psychosocial counseling commenced. The initial week proved challenging for all involved, with the client struggling with medication intake.
The client was started on Anti-TB drugs, and the regimen was optimized to ABC-3TC  (120/60 mg)-DTG  (10 mg), dispensed according to weight. The DTG dose was doubled. The client was enrolled in the nutrition unit, monitored in isolation, and discharged at 18 kg with significant improvement.
Post-discharge, return visits included intensive adherence counseling, ART literacy, Anti-TB drugs, and ARV refills. The OVC implementing partner  (AVSI) facilitated monthly home visits, including adherence assessments, psychosocial support, and nutrition support. Six months later, the viral load decreased to 1720 copies/ml from 343,000 copies/ml at Ikumba HC III.
However, on 9th May 2023, the client's viral load remained non-suppressed at 1560 copies/ml, leading to the re-initiation of adherence counseling. A sample for HIV drug resistance was also collected on 9th May 2023, and results uploaded to the database towards the end of July 2023."

9555,11239,2023/11/13 14:31:52,"Client is a 20-year-old male who has been undergoing multiple IAC sessions since 2021. The client, unfortunately, is a total orphan, with his family support currently being a grandmother residing in Kazo-Kampala and a cousin brother employed at a furniture workshop in Kubiri, where the client also engages in furniture work under a different boss.
On 13/11/2023, I endeavoured to communicate with the client via his bossâ¬"" number, seeking permission to interact with him. Regrettably, the client's boss informed me that the client was currently away from the workshop. 
Subsequently, I contacted the cousin brother, Mr. L.R, who shared valuable insights into the client's situation.
Cousin brother conveyed that the client has exhibited challenging behavior and tends not to take advice from him but also their grandmother. 
He noted a previous arrangement where the client would collect his medications from his residence every evening at 8 pm when they both resided in close proximity at Kubbiri; though now cousin brother shifted to Kazo-Kampala. However, a disagreement came out, leading to the client feeling insulted as being treated like a child and opting charge of his medications, causing a strain in their relationship.
Despite working in the same area on Kubbiri furniture street, the client now maintains a distant relationship with his cousin brother. The cousin further mentioned that the client tends to associate with a particular group of youths, especially after work, and no longer acknowledges him as his brother.
When inquired if the grandmother still supports the client's adherence to treatment, the cousin expressed concerns about the client's manipulative behavior. He noted that the client often provides misleading information to their grandmother, falsely claiming improvements in treatment adherence. Despite the grandmother's attempts to encourage better adherence, the client appears resistant to all sorts of advice.
Regarding previously reported adherence barriers, such as denied permission from workshop by boss and challenges in finding what to eat, the cousin denied these claims, asserting that the client tends to manipulate situations and provide misleading information, telling people what they want to hear.

On 8th January 2024, I engaged in a telephone conversation with the client's aunt, who works as a lecturer somewhere within Kampala. She provided insight into the client's situation, currently staying under the care of the paternal grandmother in Kiryandongo district.
The client is the youngest among three siblings, with their elder sister receiving care at Dima H/C III-Kiryandongo district, reportedly managing medications well. 
The second sibling, a boy yet to join S.6, resides with the grandfather from Gulu and is under care at Lacho hospital. The aunt also financially supports his education and praises his academic performance, unlike the client in question.
The client, along with siblings, lost their both parents with the latest father who passed on last year, rendering them total orphans. Currently attending day school-P.4 class, the client occasionally spends holidays with the aunt in Kampala.
The aunt highlighted past challenges in treatment adherence due to interference by a nephew who used to take him away from the caretaker grandmother, causing drug interruptions more often. However, she assured that the grandmother now ensures close monitoring through DOTs and the aunt once in a while calls to crosscheck the treatment progress.
About the nutrition issues, the aunt raised concerns about poor clientâ¬""s appetite and on their last visit at clinic, they were advised by the Doctor to buy certain medicines, temporarily out of stock at pharmacy which she was not able to buy at a time but plans to get them. Additionally, the aunt indicated that their grandâ¬""s family in the village is well supported by her eldest son based in London, ensuring no financial struggles for food supplies so the client is well taken care of. 
The aunt finally assured me that previously had given up on this boy because of not understanding his situation; but is ready to continue to support him to attain good health and remain on treatment until a reasonable age.

The father stays in Kampala and comes once in a while and rarely sends support to his home. He is a boda boda rider. The mother intentionally refuses to give him drugs claiming that since she feels nauseated by the drugs, the son must be feeling the same. Both mother and child would miss their appointments despite several reminders. Because of this reason, KCHS and the facility team (counselor) started conducting joint home visits and bi-weekly IAC. The major cause for the non-suppression of the child was still found to be the mother refusing to give him the drugs. A probation officer was involved to caution the mother but there was no change. Health education on the importance of good adherence was given plus HIV literacy messages provided. More topics like personal hygiene and sanitation, good nutrition practices were covered on those home visits. KCHS supported the establishment of a back yard garden at home as well as providing emergency food, which encouraged the mother to put in more effort in taking care of the child and herself. A family discussion was held with KCHS and a counselor to look for another treatment supporter since the mother was not regularly giving the child the drugs.

She has some form of Stigma and therefore doesnâ¬""t want the community leaders/VHT to know her HIV status or support her adherence. This makes her lack a proper treatment supporter


3.	Pill Burden

Her drugs are not properly administered. She tends to mix up the doses. She sometimes takes RTV twice instead of taking it once and DRV once not twice.
She takes drugs at irregular time and doses subsequently. She claims whenever she takes drugs on an empty stomach she gets stomach upsets and so skips some doses.

Currently no serious medical condition registered. Done TB LAM with negative result.  
The sequence of her viral load and CD4 count are listed below.

OJ is a 16-year-old boy who lives in Okomo village, Alolololo parish, and Adwir sub-county. We discovered that the child dropped out of school in p.1 and he is now home. The child started growing up with the mother only because the father had divorced the mother because of domestic violence. The father then brought the child with him when the child was at 7 years, it became hard for the father to manage the child since he had wired behaviours which he had to involve other members of the family to help talk to the child but nothing has changed. The child has joined bad groups to the extent of steeling chicken from home with his friends which has made the caregiver very disappointed and there is loss of hope in him by the father. The child is not taking medication regularly and no one in the family has ever taken time to know whether he is taking drugs or not because of his behaviours. OJ is the only positive person in the household and the caregivers lacked knowledge on adherence and its importance. The caregiver and the child were advised to join SINOVUYO group and was advised to keep having a one on one talk with the child.

Patient Profile Overview
N.C is a 21-year old, who has had fluctuating detectable viral loads since 2020 despite multiple IAC sessions with the client.
====Family background
Client comes from a supportive family with both parents. Her mother is under care at the Baylor clinic, while her father receives treatment at another ART site. Both parents have consistently adhered to their treatments, as confirmed by client's mother. She is the youngest of six siblings. Sadly, her second-to-last sibling who made the seventh child passed away in 2009 due to advanced HIV late diagnosis.
She currently resides with her third-born sister in Nateete and is employed as a tailor. Previously, she lived with her parents in Busunju-Wakiso before relocating to sisterâ¬""s home three years ago.
===Education/school
Recently, N.C completed vocational training in both hairdressing and tailoring and is expected to graduate in a few weeks.
===Adherence barriers and interventions
I engaged the mother via phone call on 15/04/2024 who revealed she was the first person to initiate ART even before her husband when the client under question was only 3 years. By that time, the husband was critically ill and hospitalised and she also tested and had to be started on treatment before the husband. She confirmed that they are both doing well on their treatments as are always suppressed.
Mother confirmed that the child is the only one amongst the siblings who is on treatment besides the other son who past on at an early stage.
Concerning drug adherence, the mother notably said client used to attend boarding schools throughout and there was a time when she returned home from school and noticed 3 full tins of tablets. On probing, the client opened up that was dodging drugs as she was being served posho at school and there after experienced nausea. By that time, she studying from Kasubi and they decided to be delivering food items daily with consent from school authority.
The mother also notably said that child was diagnosed with HIV at around 10 years after falling ill and stripped with Kisipi  (herpes zoster / shingles) which later left a huge scar on the side of her face next to the eye; her growth was also retarded over time.
She also added that child was lately disclosed to at 17 years as she looked stunted like a very young kid and counsellors perceived her as very little child and kept postponing disclosure.
All along the mother kept encouraging the client take drugs to treat the scar on her face until was disclosed to at 17 years. They even used to get appointments with a certain Doctor in Mulago who could give injections to curb the widening of the scar.
Regarding the general wellbeing, mother said that she noted unusual behaviours of; short-temperedness  (okunyiganyiga, entondo) which she did not have during her early childhood though she was generally active. Her older siblings are very supportive and even the time she was a vocational school, they would give her upkeep and visit her occasionally.
I also had a conversation with the sister  (current treatment supporter) who noted that got some communication from their mum after visiting the clinic 2 months back that client was not performing well on treatment.
She then had an open discussion with her and revealed that had issues with time management; her drug time is set at 7pm yet returns from work at around 10pm of beyond so occasionally skipped drugs. She then arranged to switch her drug time to 9am as she always leaves home at 9:30am after taking break-tea. I noted that client had been on the tailoring job for over 1 years as could go there during the holiday break from the vocational institute.
The sister is not aware of any sexual relationships the client may be having and reported that the client is very active being surrounded by a good social network of people both at her workplace and at home.
I was not able to discuss with client as she lost the phone 1 month ago yet was already at work.
The sister and the mum all ended on a note to continue to encourage the client improve her adherence to achieve suppression.
