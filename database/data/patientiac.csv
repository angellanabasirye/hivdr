5425,4274,"8,13,3","Joan was represented at the last visit because she was unwell but today she has reported to the clinic. She is severely wasted and sits on a cushion as she has a rectovaginal fistula and loss of buttocks muscle. She has full insight into her adherence and has not missed ART. She is very knowledgeable on HIV, how her immunity is weakened by a detected VL and how ARVs control the virus so that it does not damage her immunity. She is knowledgeable that her current severe illness includes severe wasting, pneumonia  (not TB) and a recto- vaginal fistula all due to reduced immunity because she stopped taking her treatment in 2016. She stopped taking her ART in S.2 out of stubbornness, her mother had told her that if she skipped a dose she would die so one day she skipped just to dare the devil and realized she did not die. She then started to doubt if she really had HIV and if she should take her drugs daily. She then decided to take the drugs haphazardly until one time she was off for a month and nothing happened, she then went off treatment for a year and even gained weight and looked good. Her adherence deteriorated and when she was switched to 2nd line she looked at the pill size and decided she did not need it because she was feeling and looking healthy. She started to take a lot of alcohol and engage in sex as she felt that was a cool life to live. Her boyfriend once did a home based HIV test with her and she was negative so she even stopped believing she has ever had HIV. She stopped in S.4 and took a certificate program and was working at the same time and all was well.  In January of this year she started to fall sick and soon realized she had only sabotaged herself. She tried to commit suicide by over dosing herself on her mom's insulin but a voice in her told her she was not being kind to her family that has shown her so much love and even her sister would die because she had seen her faint when she saw how sick she was at Kiruddu hospital. She has since not had suicidal ideas and has a renewed hope in her faith. Her turn around time was when she was so sick and could not talk but was fully conscious when admitted at Kiruddu. The doctors asked her mom to take her home and she dies as there was nothing they could do. She badly wanted to tell them that she was so sick she should be in hospital not home but she could not speak due to severe weakness. Her family cried and started to arrange for her burial and that really scared her.  She says she has learnt from her mistakes and indeed requests to be allowed to talk to youth at the COE so that they see how AIDS looks like and know they are on treatment not for anyone else but themselves.  The VL is 2480cp/ml and she wanted to know if she could test again to see where it has reached since she is adhering and Dr. Fairuzi had earlier explained to her that her resistance profile showed all the drugs were working. She has been explained to the IAC process and it will be done one month after the 3rd IAC. Recently her greatest barrier to treatment was vomiting the medicines but lately she is able to put the pills in her favorite meal - posho and swallow small balls of it with the pill pushed in the middle. Ever since she started this for now over a month she has not vomited her medicines. Also her mother does DOTS.   ADVISE As much as Joan now has insight into her disease and she says she learnt from her mistakes we have none the less discussed on the importance of good adherence and the poor health risks that come with poor adherence such as the ill health she is experiencing now. She has been advised to continue to take all her oral ART treatment at the same time every day and to feel free to call us in case she feels she wants to talk to someone.    ASSIST Since putting medicines into posho and her renewed faith is her game changer she has been encouraged to continue with them.   AGREE We have agreed she continues to adhere while following the 5R's on time, route, dose amount of tablets, medicine type and frequency of treatment. Also she has a very loving family in fact her aunt has asked to be the one to look after her since she operates a clinic and is a health worker. This is to help her diabetic mother also have some rest because they were so long at Kiruddu and mom is exhausted.   ARRANGE Since she is very weak and is just coming in from a hospital discharge she has been encouraged to return every 2 weeks as we monitor her general health. Also when she returns we will see how she can be a part of the peer support meeting to encourage youth to adhere to treatment.
